markdown (md) is an easy file extension to store text in formatted form

commit is a place holder text.

when we see the edits from the commits section in the github page of a specific file....green + indicates that a new line has been added and red - indicates a paritcular line has been removed and white indicates no change

## subheader
we use "git clone ....." command to cone a repo from online to offline storage.
and "##" is used to draw a sub heading.
and when a file is modifies and the status is tracked... we see that it is in stagged format.
