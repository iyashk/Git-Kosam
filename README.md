markdown (md) is an easy file extension to store text in formatted form

commit is a place holder text.

when we see the edits from the commits section in the github page of a specific file....green + indicates that a new line has been added and red - indicates a paritcular line has been removed and white indicates no change

## subheader
we use "git clone ....." command to cone a repo from online to offline storage.
and "##" is used to draw a sub heading.
and when a file is modifies and the status is tracked... we see that it is in stagged format.

"git add ." - will add all the files that are added in the offine version.
"git add file name" will add the specific file name.

## subheader -2
"git commit -m text" this will commit a message while changing the folder or file and doing the commit - this shows what and why the commit is made
 
## subheader - 3
git push - it has 2 parts and origin and a master "origin - is for the location of our git repo" , "master - is the branch into which we want to push our files into"

## subheader - 3
 we can use github push using the source control on vscod ebut we should initialize the repo before..
 for that we need to click the (tick) symbol to commit the message and then push the repo into git using the push on the ... dots menu.

 ## subheader - 4
   ### branch on git
   we create new branch to test our program and then..to check all the current branches wer use "git branch"

   to switch between branches we use the command "git checkout -b <branc name>" if no such branch exists then a new branch is creasted in the given name..
   and now we swtich to this branch
